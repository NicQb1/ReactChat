# Deployment Assistant

A React + Vite sample that uses Microsoft Fluent UI components. The main page shows a deployment checklist in a TreeView
and a chat surface for interacting with a Microsoft Foundation Workflow assistant.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed localhost URL.

> Note: If package installs are blocked in your environment, mirror dependencies or vendor them locally before running the app.
